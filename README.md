<h4>Why Poker?</h4>
Poker is a non-deterministic game of imperfect information. The current progress on Poker with computers was not a huge success, while in many other games computers are at the same level as the top human players in both deterministic and perfect information games. Poker as such poses a very challenging challenge with a large number of interesting properties.
