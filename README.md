<h1>MCTS-Poker</h1>
Heuristic search algorithm for No Limit Texas Hold'em.
This engine is built to find clusters of player types in poker games and learn opponent models that predict players moves given his cards. 


<h4>Why Poker?</h4>
Poker is a non-deterministic game of imperfect information. Computers have had only limited success in games of this type so far, whereas they are playing at human grandmaster level in many deterministic or perfect information games. Poker is challenging because of a large number of interesting properties like incomplete knowledge, multiple competing agents, risk management, opponent modelling, deception and dealing with unreliable information.
